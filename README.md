Hi, I am [@ashtom](https://github.com/ashtom). üëã I am the [incoming CEO](https://github.blog/2021-11-03-building-the-next-phase-of-github-together/) of [GitHub](https://github.com/github) and love building products that make developers lives easier. We‚Äôre always open to hearing your feedback so drop us a note (or your entire GitHub wishlist) in [Discussions](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions). I grew up in üá©üá™, live in the Pacific Northwest of the üá∫üá∏, and you may know me as the co-founder of HockeyApp. I‚Äôm also a LEGO enthusiast and love turning that GitHub contribution graph ‚¨áÔ∏è more green üü© in my spare time. The below list are things I directly worked on in the past years.
