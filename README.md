Hi, I am [@ashtom](https://github.com/ashtom) and I am a developer. 👋 I recently [left my job](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/goodbye-github/) to start building something new. Previously, I was the [CEO](https://github.blog/2021-11-03-building-the-next-phase-of-github-together/) of [@GitHub](https://github.com). I grew up in 🇩🇪, live in the Pacific Northwest of the 🇺🇸, I'm a LEGO enthusiast, and love turning that GitHub contribution graph ⬇️ more green 🟩 whenever I find time to code.
